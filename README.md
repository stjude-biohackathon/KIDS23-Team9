# KIDS23-Team9

## Summary

Through the CCI team the department has been strategically acquiring small molecules with known biological activities against one or more gene targets. This collection of molecules is known as the CBT Mechanism of Action compound set or library. We would like to build upon this set which will continue to grow. These compounds will be screened against a number of target and cellular assays. These assays will provide a set of "active" compounds in that assay. Given the set of compounds which are active we would like to identify and map the gene targets and pathways which may be involved. Additionally, the ability to visualize the activity of each pathway to the user would be useful. In this case there is no existing solution. It would add new capability for the department.
